\bibentry{lecun2015deep}

\textit{2. Non-Refereed Articles}

\textit{3. Books}

\textit{4. Book Chapters}

\textit{5. Abstracts}

\textit{6. Other}


Please provide full citations (please do not abbreviate journal titles), including beginning and ending page numbers. 
Be clear about the status of works in progress, e.g., ``in press'' means written, reviewed, accepted, and waiting for publication. 
Please include anticipated date of publication. 
Work ``currently under review'' (i.e., not yet accepted for publication) should be included if the work is complete and has been submitted for review. 
Work currently under development but not yet submitted should not be included.

If a work under review is accepted for publication before your dossier has been forwarded by the department (or equivalent unit) to the next level for review, you should notify the department (or equivalent unit) committee chairperson. 
The department (or equivalent unit) may then consider the work ``in press'' and update the dossier accordingly.

Where co-authoring is extensive and not typical in the field, a major collaborator should be invited by the promotion committee to indicate in a letter the contributions made by the candidate to the joint work (one letter may address multiple publications by the team, if applicable). 
Where co-authoring is common in your field, it may be helpful to indicate that in your statement on scholarship. 
Be sure to indicate publications co-authored with graduate and undergraduate students. 
Edited volumes should be clearly identified as such.

Presentations and proceedings should be listed separately by date. 
Internally published technical reports, workbooks, etc. should be separate from peer-reviewed publications.
